# Requirements

HIPA<sup>cc</sup> is a source-to-source compiler based on Clang/LLVM. To build HIPA<sup>cc</sup> from source, either the development package of Clang/LLVM and libc++ is required, or the corresponding components from the Clang/LLVM have to be installed manually:

* [llvm](https://llvm.org)
* [clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
* [compiler-rt](https://compiler-rt.llvm.org)
* [libc++](https://libcxx.llvm.org)
* [libc++abi](https://libcxxabi.llvm.org) (on GNU/Linux when using Clang as target compiler)
* [polly](https://polly.llvm.org) (optional)

HIPA<sup>cc</sup> works only with the release version of Clang/LLVM listed in [dependencies.sh](https://github.com/hipacc/hipacc/blob/master/dependencies.sh), which corresponds to the current Clang/LLVM 4.0 release version.

### Windows
While HIPA<sup>cc</sup> is mainly developed under GNU Linux and macOS, it compiles and runs under Windows as well. Use [msys2](https://www.msys2.org) to compile HIPA<sup>cc</sup> on Windows. Make sure that development packages are installed. The source files generated by HIPA<sup>cc</sup> can then be compiled in Visual Studio.


# Installation

The build system of HIPA<sup>cc</sup> uses CMake (2.8.12 or later) and requires installation to an absolute path:
```bash
cd hipacc
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/release
make && make install
```
Note that Xcode and the command line tools are required to build HIPA<sup>cc</sup> on macOS (use xcode-select --install to install command line tools).

A list of CMake options that are used by HIPA<sup>cc</sup> to find headers and libraries for its various back ends (CUDA, OpenCL, and Renderscript) can be found in the [INSTALL](https://github.com/hipacc/hipacc/blob/master/INSTALL) file.


# First Run

After building and installing HIPA<sup>cc</sup> successfully, you are ready to use HIPA<sup>cc</sup>. To verify that everything is working, generate and execute a program using HIPA<sup>cc</sup>. Go to your installation directory and call make cuda. This translates the source file specified by the TEST_CASE environment variable into a version that runs on the GPU using CUDA and executes it. Similarly, the same program can be translated to OpenCL for different device types (opencl-acc, opencl-cpu, opencl-gpu) as well as standard C++ code (cpu). For execution on Android, Renderscript (renderscript) and Filterscript (filterscript) code can be generated.
```bash
cd hipacc/build/release
TEST_CASE=tests/opencv_gaussian_8uc1 make cuda
./main_cuda
```

For execution on Android devices, the generated binary is configured to store data in /data/local/tmp. The same directory can be used for the binary itself:
```bash
adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp
adb push main_renderscript /data/local/tmp
adb shell /data/local/tmp/main_renderscript
```
